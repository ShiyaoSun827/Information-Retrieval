# Advanced Information Retrieval System

## Overview: Efficient Document Retrieval and Query Processing

This project implements a **high-performance Information Retrieval (IR) system**, designed to process and manage large-scale text collections efficiently. It integrates advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**, **Boolean and ranked retrieval models**, and **statistical ranking methods**, making it a powerful tool for structured text searching and retrieval.

## Key Technologies and Techniques

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Tokenization and Normalization**: Convert text into tokens using **NLTK-based techniques**, including **case folding, stemming, and lemmatization**.
- **TF-IDF Scoring and Cosine Similarity**: Utilize **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** weighting and **cosine similarity** for ranking.
- **Probabilistic Language Models (PLM)**: Implement **Bayesian probability models** for text classification and ranking.
- **Levenshtein Distance for Approximate Matching**: Enhance recall through fuzzy search techniques.

### 2. Boolean and Ranked Retrieval Models
- **Boolean Query Processing**: Support logical operations such as **AND, OR, and NOT**.
- **Vector Space Model (VSM)**: Represent documents as numerical vectors in multi-dimensional space for similarity-based ranking.
- **Inverted Indexing**: Store term occurrences using an optimized **inverted index** to enable rapid query execution.

### 3. Evaluation and Optimization
- **Precision and Recall Metrics**: Measure retrieval effectiveness.
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP) & F1-Score**: Evaluate ranking and classification accuracy.
- **Incidence Matrix Optimization**: Reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency.
